# **Tic Tac Toe**

Tic-tac-toe has been a part of almost everyone‚Äôs childhood.
While the game of tic-tac-toe is really old, dating back to ancient Egyptians at around 1300 B.C., the underlying principles of the game have endured the test of time. The game seems simple enough. Two opponents, one using X and one using O, use a 3 x 3 grid to mark their symbols. The first one to get all three of his/her symbols in a row, whether it‚Äôs diagonal, horizontal, or vertical, wins the game.
